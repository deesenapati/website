## About

### 

<p> Over the past 6 Years, before my role as a designer, I have donned roles in Marketing - Community Manager, Sales, Media planning and campaing manager(SEM). The learnings from these roles have given me a unique advantage in Design. As a Product Designer, I strive to create experiences that feel intutive.</p>
<p> As a naturally curious individual, I aspire to embrace experiences that are unique. I constantly love learning about Front-end web development, Motion design, Investing and minimalistic life style. I also love organizing (Digital/IRL) and bookmarking awesome resources.</p>

<p> Some of my future aspirations involve - owning a hydroponic farm, learning carpentary, Starting a lifestyle brand with recycled products.</p>
